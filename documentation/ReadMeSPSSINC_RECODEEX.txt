This zip file contains the materials for the extension command

SPSSINC RECODEEX

The command extends the capabilities of the built-in RECODE command by
- allowing the use of date and time constants
- automatically generating value labels for the output variables
- automatically generating a variable label.

This material requires at least 
SPSS Statistics 17 and the Python plug-in.

It includes the syntax definition and the implementation file.
There is no custom dialog for this command, because a good dialog
would require some features not current available in the CDB.

To install this procedure, 
Unzip all of the files into the extensions subdirectory of your 
SPSS Statistics installation.

2. In SPSS Statistics, use
Utilties>Install Custom Dialog
to add this item to the menus.

Questions and comments should be directed to the 
SPSS Developer Central Python Programmability forum.
