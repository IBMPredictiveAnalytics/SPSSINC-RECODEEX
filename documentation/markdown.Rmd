SPSSINC RECODEEX Extension Command
==================================

Recode variables into other variables with optional variable and value label generation
and support for dates.

SPSSINC RECODEEX *inputvarlist*^&#42; = *outputvarlist*^&#42;

/RECODES "*(input value(s) = recode)*^&#42; ...   
(else=COPY^&#42;&#42; or SYSMIS})"

/OPTIONS STRINGSIZE=*n*  
VALUELABELS=YES^&#42;&#42; or NO  
USEINPUTVALLABELS=NO^&#42;&#42; or YES  
COPYVARIABLELABELS=YES^&#42;&#42; or NO  
SUFFIX="*value*"   
PREFIX="*value*"

/HELP

^&#42; Required  
^&#42;&#42; Default

SPSSINC RECODEEX /HELP displays this help and does nothing else.

Examples:
```
RECODEEX fatherage motherage = fatheragerc motheragerc
/RECODES "(LO THRU 50=1) (51 thru 75=2) (ELSE=COPY)"
/OPTIONS SUFFIX="rc".

RECODEEX bdate = bdaterc
/RECODES "(LO THRU 1950-12-31=1)(1951-01-01 THRU 1990-12-31=2)".

RECODE duration = durationrc
/RECODES "(LO THRU 10 12:00:00=1)(10 12:00:00 THRU HIGH=2)".
```

This command extends the built-in RECODE command in several ways.
* Date or time constants are used for variables of these types
* Value labels can be automatically generated for the outputs
* Variable labels can be copied
* Variable types can be changed for the output variables.

**inputvarlist** specifies the variables to be recoded.  
They must all have the same type
(numeric, string, a date format, or a time format).  
MOYR, WKYR and WKDAY formats are not supported.

**outputvarlist** specifies an equal number of variables for the results.
If **STRINGSIZE** is specified,
the output variables will all be made strings of that length.
The type of any existing variables will be
changed to match if necessary.  If STRINGSIZE is not specified, no variable types
will be changed, and any new variables will be numeric.
A variable cannot be used as both an input and output variable.

RECODE
------
Recode specifications have the same general form as for the RECODE command:  
```
(input-values = output-value)
```
See the RECODE command for details.
Unlike the RECODE commmand, *the entire recode value specification* must be enclosed in quotes.
Input or output string values must also be quoted.

If the variables have a date format, recode values have the form *yyyy-mm-dd*.
If the values have a time format, recode values have the form `hh:mm`, `hh:mm:ss.ss`
or these forms preceded by days, e.g., `10 08:03`.

OPTIONS
-------
**STRINGSIZE** specifies that the output variables should all be strings of that
length (in bytes).

**VALUELABELS** specifies whether value labels should be created for the output values.
They will consist of the input values that are mapped to each output with two caveats:
An else specification does not contribute to the labels.
If an input value is mapped to more than one output value, it will appear in each corresponding
value label even though the RECODE command processes from left to right.
If the generated label is too long, it is truncated and ... is appended.

**USEINPUTVALLABELS** specifies whether the created value labels
should contain the input values or their value labels.  This
keyword is ignored if VALUELABELS=NO.  If the input value
labels are used and a range specification appears, that
specification is used as the value label.

If **COPYVARIABLELABELS**=YES, the variable label, if any, of each input variable
will be copied to the output variable.  **PREFIX** and **SUFFIX** can specify text to be
prepended or appended to the label with a separating blank.
